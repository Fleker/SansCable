SansCable API
=========

Data API along with other open code related to the project (available at felkerdigitalmedia.com/sanscable/)

Check out the Wiki for information on how to use the Data API.

This code allows you to pull data from YouTube and Vimeo (videos, users, and playlists) and standardizes all the parameters to make it easy to integrate multiple video sources in your application.

The code is used in Sans Cable, a website that acts as a 'DVR for web video' allowing you to pause and resume video inbetween sessions, along with getting all videos from subscriptions.
